### Comparison with Other Major Auto Manufacturers

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/B Ratio |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **TSLA** | 132.0331  | 19.747868 |
| GM      | 12.31     | 1.54      |
| Ford    | 20.75     | 2.13      |
| Toyota  | 13.41     | 1.23      |

Tesla's significantly higher valuation ratios compared to traditional automakers suggest it may be overvalued based on these metrics. However, Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle segment and its growth potential might justify these valuations for some investors.

### Conclusion
Based on the fundamental data and analyst recommendations, Tesla appears overvalued by traditional metrics like P/E and P/B ratios compared to its industry peers. Still, its innovative edge, growth potential, and investor sentiment could justify its current valuation. Investors should consider both financial and non-financial factors and conduct further research tailored to their investment strategies.
